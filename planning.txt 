First we have 2 tracks (Lorient - Groix) and (Quiberon - Belle-île)

that means we have 4 possible journeys 

    -Lorient --> Groix
    
    -Groix --> Lorient

    -Quiberon --> Belle-île

    -Belle-île --> Quiberon

2--------

Now these 4 journeys are run by LA CAN so 

    id1 - traject1
    id2 - traject2
    id3 - traject3
    id4 - traject4

3----------

So the process of the program is like this 

    1- ask the user for a name
    2- choose one of the 4 journeys 
    3- ask the user for a day of the month ,
    4- choose a departure hour (each journeys has its distinct hours)
    5- where gonna manage just month november 

4---------

So now i have to create a structure of traversee which holds : 

    - Liaison = (one of the 4 journeys (Liste , tableau))
    - Date = (the day of the departure the usr chose (Liste))
    - Depart = (the hour of departure the usr chose chose)

5--------

When the choice of traversee has been made i have to ask the usr

for the passengers which consist of 

    - Last name 
    - First name 
    - choose the category of the passengers (adulte,... each one has a code that
    corresponds to a table which has all info about that category like price...)
    
and for vehicules its ; 

    - choosing the category of the vehicule(trotinette... which corresponds to
    a table that has all info about each vehicule so code, price .... )
    - the quantity of the vehicule

6--------

After the user enters all info i need to show a summary of choices
the user did so like    

    - journey : one of the 4 
    - date : on the...
    - heure de depart : at... 
    - passengers : ...
    - vehicules : .... 
    - total price : ....
